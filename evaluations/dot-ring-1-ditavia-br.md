- **Application Document:** `dotring.md`
- **Milestone:** 1

| Number | Deliverable | Accepted | Link | Evaluation Notes |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 0a. | License | [x] | `dot-ring/LICENSE` | MIT license present as required. |
| 0b. | Documentation | [x] | `dot-ring/README.md`, `dot-ring/TESTING.md` | Usage, setup, and test instructions documented, matching scope. |
| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | [x] | `dot-ring/tests/`, `dot-ring/TESTING.md` | `python -m pytest --cov=dot_ring --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html tests` now passes (51 tests) with total coverage 91 %; module-level coverage ≥80 % across the codebase. |
| 0d. | Docker | [x] | `dot-ring/Dockerfile` | Dockerfile provisions dependencies (including blst build) and runs pytest with coverage. |
| 1.1 | Bandersnatch Curve Implementation | [x] | `dot-ring/dot_ring/curve/specs/bandersnatch.py` | Implements Bandersnatch parameters with GLV hooks per spec (`BandersnatchCurve`, `BandersnatchPoint`). |
| 1.2 | Curve Families & Core Arithmetic | [x] | `dot-ring/dot_ring/curve/` | Additional property-based tests lift `field_element.py` to 85 % and `sw_affine_point.py` to 81 %; coverage meets ≥80 %. |
| 1.3 | All Curves | [x] | `dot-ring/dot_ring/curve/specs/` | Newly added tests raise remaining curve modules (e.g., `curve/specs/ed25519.py` 96 %) above 80 %. |
| 1.4 | Hash-to-Curve Suites | [x] | `dot-ring/tests/test_h2c_suites/` | RFC 9380 vectors plus supplementary tests meet the ≥80 % coverage requirement for associated code paths. |
| 2.1 | IETF VRF Implementation | [x] | `dot-ring/dot_ring/vrf/ietf/ietf.py` | Implements keygen/prove/verify per RFC 9381 with ≥97 % coverage. |
| 2.2 | IETF VRF Tests | [x] | `dot-ring/tests/test_vrfs/test_ietf/` | Suite exercises the IETF VRF across supported curves with adequate coverage. |
| 3.1 | Pedersen VRF Implementation | [x] | `dot-ring/dot_ring/vrf/pedersen/pedersen.py` | Pedersen VRF logic covered (>97 %). |
| 3.2 | Pedersen VRF Tests | [x] | `dot-ring/tests/test_vrfs/test_pedersen/` | Pedersen vectors executed with sufficient coverage. |
| 4.1 | Ring Proof Implementation | [x] | `dot-ring/dot_ring/ring_proof/` | `ring_proof/pcs/kzg.py` now 84 %; third-party MSM path covered. |
| 4.2 | Ring Proof Tests | [x] | `dot-ring/tests/test_ring_proof/`, `tests/test_ring_vrf_with_third_party_msm.py` | MSM test skips gracefully when `blst` is absent; README documents optional dependency. |
| 5.1 | Ring VRF Implementation | [x] | `dot-ring/dot_ring/vrf/ring/ring_vrf.py` | Ring VRF assembly covered (>96 %) and functionally validated. |
| 5.2 | Ring VRF Tests | [x] | `dot-ring/tests/test_vrfs/test_ring_vrf/` | Bandersnatch ring-VRF vectors executed successfully. |

**Additional notes**
- Coverage from the latest run confirms all modules ≥80 %; highlighted examples: `field_element.py` 85 %, `sw_affine_point.py` 81 %, `kzg.py` 84 %.
- `tests/test_ring_vrf_with_third_party_msm.py` uses `pytest.mark.skipif` to handle missing `blst`; reviewers can run the full suite with built-in MSM only, yet optional optimization remains testable.
- Property-based tests (`tests/test_curve_ops/test_curve_ops.py`) now verify curve group properties across supported curves, strengthening regression coverage.
- With these updates, all milestone deliverables meet acceptance criteria; no blocking issues remain.
- **Pending:** Final approval is on hold while the research team completes their assessment.
